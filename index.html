            <ul id = "list">
                <li class = "listElement">His proposition that all species of life have descended from a common ancestor is now generally accepted and considered a fundamental concept in science.</li>
                <li class = "listElement">The book (On the Origin of Species) aroused international interest, with less controversy than had greeted the popular and less scientific Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation. Though Darwin's illness kept him away from the public debates, he eagerly scrutinised the scientific response, commenting on press cuttings, reviews, articles, satires and caricatures, and corresponded on it with colleagues worldwide. The book did not explicitly discuss human origins, but included a number of hints about the animal ancestry of humans from which the inference could be made.</li>
                <li class = "listElement">In a joint publication with Alfred Russel Wallace, he introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process he called natural selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding.</li>
                <li class = "listElement">Darwin's fame and popularity led to his name being associated with ideas and movements that, at times, had only an indirect relation to his writings, and sometimes went directly against his express comments. </li>
                <li class = "listElement">Darwinism became a movement covering a wide range of evolutionary ideas.</li>
